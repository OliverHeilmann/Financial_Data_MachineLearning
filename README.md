# Financial_Data_MachineLearning
The aim of this repo is to develop a ML model which can predict stock price trends. As this is partially to develop my own skills, I have experimented with Regression, Classification and Neural Networks from Sklearn, Tensorflow and more. In order train this model, I am webscraping minute by minute financial data from Yahoo-Finance and saving this in a usable format; this data has been published freely.

This overall task is broken down into sub-projects and have been listed in order (Proj1, Proj2, etc.). This process has been a learning experience for me so there area several code snippits that are repeated (and improved on) throughout the differing projects. The code packages in each sub-folder are self contained and can be run on your local machine without the need for any additional content. 

It is worth noting that only the python scripts are required. All additional content (.csv, .pickle, folder, etc.) are not needed as the scripts automatically generate these when run. For specific information on how these programs run, see sub-folder 'README.md' sections.
